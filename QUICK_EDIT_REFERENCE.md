## ⏱️ CRITICAL TIMINGS (DO NOT MISS)

```
17.163s — 💥 DROP (WHITE FLASH → GREEN EYES)
21.451s — 💥 CLIMAX (1.43s HOLD — longest shot)
16.500s — BLACK SCREEN (0.66s tension build)
19.891s — WHITE FLASH (0.07s — shortest shot)
```

## 🎯 THE GOLDEN RULES

1. **Beat Interval: 0.352s** (170.5 BPM)
2. **Green Eyes = 12 shots ONLY** (don't overuse the hook!)
3. **Every cut in DROP on beat** (machine precision)
4. **Climax shot is LONGEST** (1.43s > all others)
5. **Black before drop = MAX tension** (0.66s void)

- Outro chair: 1.0x → 0.92x (pull away)

**Speed Ramping:**
- BUILD hands: 100% → 120%
- DROP crowd: 100% → 200%
- PEAK hands: 100% → 80% (slow down)

**Slow Motion:**

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use green eyes in more than 12 shots
- Make any shot longer than climax (1.43s)
- Miss the beat on DROP (17.163s)
- Skip the black screen (16.50-17.16s)
- Over-compress on export (<15 Mbps)

✅ **DO:**
- Lock audio to timeline
- Verify sync at sample level
- Check green color on calibrated monitor
- Test playback on mobile device
- Watch full timeline 3+ times before export

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

**Video is successful if:**
- Viewer doesn't blink during DROP (17-22s)
- Viewer remembers the green eyes
- Viewer watches twice (rewatch for details)
- Viewer feels the empty chair symbolism
- Viewer wants to hear full track

**Target stats:**
- Retention: >85%
- Rewatch rate: >60%
- Shares: High (unique visual hook)

## 🚀 ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY

**"37 seconds of hypnotic black & white punctuated by green eyes that explode at 17.163s, hold you at 21.451s, then fade into memory — all cut to a relentless 170.5 BPM heartbeat."**

**◉ СМОТРЕЛА**
*She was looking. You can't look away.*

**Print this. Tape it to your monitor. Execute flawlessly.**

---

## 📞 EMERGENCY HOTLINE

**If something's wrong, check:**

1. **Audio out of sync?**
   → Lock audio track, zoom to waveform

2. **Colors look wrong?**
   → Check Rec.709, calibrate monitor

3. **Cuts feel off-beat?**
   → Zoom timeline to sample level, adjust ±1 frame

4. **Green eyes not popping?**
   → Increase saturation to 100%, boost luminance

5. **Export file huge?**
   → Lower bitrate to 15 Mbps, check no ProRes export

6. **Render crashing?**
   → Pre-render green eyes segments, disable GPU

---

**FINAL CHECK:** Watch 17.163s at 0.25x speed. If flash → eyes transition isn't PERFECT, fix it.

**Everything else can be tweaked. The drop MUST be flawless.**
